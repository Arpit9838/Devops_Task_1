![localhost:3000](/public/images/localhost_3000.png?raw=true "Node & Express")



A simple **Node.js + Express** web app containerized with **Docker** and deployed using **Docker Compose**.  
This project is part of my **DevOps Intern Assignment**.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/) (for running locally without Docker)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)  
- Docker Compose (comes with Docker Desktop, check with `docker compose version`)

## Run Locally (Without Docker)
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-express-hello-world.git
cd node-express-hello-world

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start app
npm start
````

 Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Run with Docker

```bash

docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To stop:
